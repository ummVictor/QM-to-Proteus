## Introduction
This repository aims to provide a guide on how to convert the QM Modeling diagrams into Proteus.
#### What is QM Modeling?
  QM Modeling is a visual modeling tool that provides a user-friendly graphical interface to map out the flow and behavior of the state machines.
#### What is Proteus?
Proteus provides a textual representation of the diagrams represented in QM Modeling.


## Installation

To begin converting QM concepts to Proteus, you'll need to have the Proteus software installed on your system. You can download and install Proteus from the official [Labcenter Electronics website](https://www.labcenter.com/).

## Usage

Once you have Proteus installed, you can start converting QM concepts by creating circuits and simulations that mimic the behavior of quantum systems. This README will provide guidelines and examples to help you get started.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you can convert specific QM concepts to Proteus circuits:

- Simulating Quantum Gates
- Modeling Quantum States
- Implementing Quantum Algorithms

Each example will include step-by-step instructions and explanations to guide you through the conversion process.

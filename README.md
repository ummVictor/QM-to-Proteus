## Introduction
This repository aims to provide a guide on how to convert the QM Modeling diagrams into Proteus.
#### What is QM Modeling?
QM Modeling is a visual modeling tool that provides a user-friendly graphical interface to map out the flow and behavior of the state machines.
#### What is Proteus?
Proteus is a programming language that provides a textual representation of the diagrams represented in QM Modeling.

## Installation

To begin converting QM concepts to Proteus, you'll first need to have QM Modeling and Proteus installed on your system. 
- To download and install QM Modeling from the official [QM™ Model-Based Design Tool](https://www.state-machine.com/products/qm) 
- To download and install [Proteus](https://github.com/nasa/PROTEUS)

## Usage

Once you have QM™ Model-Based Design Tool and Proteus installed, you can start converting state machines into Proteus. 
### Examples
- Create the state machine in QM™ Model-Based Design Tool

Here are some examples of how you can convert specific QM concepts to Proteus circuits:

- Simulating Quantum Gates
- Modeling Quantum States
- Implementing Quantum Algorithms

Each example will include step-by-step instructions and explanations to guide you through the conversion process.
